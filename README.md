# Simple-Monte-Carlo

The Nagel-Schreckenberg model is a theoretical model for simulating the flow of traffic on a freeway. Each time cycle cars goes through four processes.
1. Acceleration - If the car is not at maximum velocity the car's velocity is increased.
2. Slowing Down - If the car is will run into a car in front of it when it moves forward, the car's velocity is reduced.
3. Random Element - The car's velocity is decreased by one speed unit, with probability p of occuring.
4. Movement - The car moves forward by the number of spaces of its speed.

This is a very Basic Monte Carlo Model that I built in Python after reading about the topic in The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb. 
I am currently building what will hopefully be a more complex model of a computer network using concepts from Graph Theory. This project is housed in the same repository at the current time, and will be built in C++.

Thanks for checking out my project!
